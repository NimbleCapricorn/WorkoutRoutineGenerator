# WorkoutRoutineGenerator

## Motivation
This a workout routine generator that I created because I had enough of bullshiter youtubers selling their bullshit workout routines for exorbitant prices. 4.99$ a month for a generic do 3 sets of 5 style workout routine? With fixed weight numbers so that you can't even adjust once you get stronger? Get the f** out of here! 

## License:
Everything under this repo is code that I wrote. If you wish to use it, fork it, expand upon it, rewrite it, you can go for it. The more people fork it, use it, contribute to it, the harder it is to steal it. So please if you have some time, consider contributing, or at least try it out, share with people who might enjoy what this software can be used for. That way noone can claim it as their own and exploit my and other people's work that way. 

## How to guides
A basic user manual can be found in the repo named User Manual. If in doubt, please open an issue, as I would like to expand documentation by people getting to know the program and raising questions and problems to solve. (I would rather not write 30 pages of documentation if only I am gonna use this repo)
