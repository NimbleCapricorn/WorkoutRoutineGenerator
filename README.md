# WorkoutRoutineGenerator

## Motivation
This a workout routine generator that I created because I had enough of bullshiter youtubers selling their bullshit workout routines for exorbitant prices. 4.99$ a month for a generic do 3 sets of 5 style workout routine? With fixed weight numbers so that you can't even adjust once you get stronger? Get the f** out of here! 

## License:
Everything under this repo is code that I wrote. If you wish to use it, fork it, expand upon it, rewrite it, you can go for it. This software however can be sold as well as per the MIT license. So the more people fork it, use it, contribute to it, the harder it is to steal it. So please if you have some time, consider contributing, or at least try it out, share with people who might enjoy what this software can be used for. That way noone can claim it as their own and exploit my and other people's work that way. 

## How to guides
These will come gradually as we approach release 1.0, but the code should be self-explanatory enough that you can just use it with a bit of digging. I would start at ProgramGenerator.py, as that is the main script.
