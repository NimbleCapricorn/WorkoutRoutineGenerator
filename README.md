# WorkoutRoutineGenerator

## Motivation
This a workout routine generator that I created because I had enough of bullshiter youtubers selling their bullshit workout routines for exorbitant prices. 4.99$ a month for a generic do 3 sets of 5 style workout routine? With fixed weight numbers so that you can't even adjust once you get stronger? Get the f** out of here! 

## License:
Everything under this repo is code that I wrote. If you wish to use it, fork it, expand upon it, rewrite it, you can go for it. BUT I strongly forbid every type of monetization on this repo or everything generated through it in any shape or form. If you use anything I wrote, don't profit from it monetarily. 

## How to guides
These will come gradually as we approach release 1.0, but the code should be self-explanatory enough that you can just use it with a bit of digging. I would start at ProgramGenerator.py, as that is the main script.
